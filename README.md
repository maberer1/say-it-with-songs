## Project Description 
My app is a simple, interactive interface that allows a user to create a playlist that uses song titles to display a custom meesage.

My project is inspired by popular culture where communicating (especially humor) through sequential song names in a playlist is rising in popularity/relevance.

## User Stories
1. As a hopeless romantic, I want to create a thoughtful present for my lover, so that I convey my undying affection and fondness towards them.
2. As a meme lord troll, I want to create a stupid joke based on a very specific reference, so that all of my friends and instagram followers know that I'm original and hilarious.
3. As an angsty youth, I want to express my discontent, so that I can express my desire for anarchy and rebellion in a healthy way.
4. As a personality hire, I want to create a work-appropriate joke for my team, so that I can lighten the mood and express my comraderie.

Each user is looking to create a message that expresses their individuality in order to communicate some emotion.


### MVP Goals
As a Minimum Viable Product, a user will be able to:
1. Name a playlist.
2. Input text to be used to create a playlist.
3. Receive a playlist of song titles that mimic user input.

### Stretch Goals
My Stretch Goal would be to link this project to Spotify using OAuth verification.
